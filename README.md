# Just a boring project

This repository contains schematic but not board design files of YAMAHA's EXFLM module which designed by myself because I don't want it be copied everywhere easily.

If you want the module, please contact me via my E-mail, find my shop in second hand Taobao market or you can also reach <https://sector101.co.uk/exflm.html> to get one (not related to me) in case you're not in China and I'm too busy to send it via international post.

This EXFLM module can be configured as 8MB(4MW) or 16MB(8MW) two configuration. Besides, this board supports experimental 32MB configuration, you can read the schematic to check out it.
